Fatally the question that whether life is worth living was came to an indivisual's childhood, struggling to awaken or fighting for light then became an inevitable part of his existence.

One day when I was perhaps dreaming, somebody told me that there is a long river in front of everyone, you can see its eternal preach and hear the insane blue of it, only if your eyes are closed and your ears are covered. A river deeper than time,  with transparent water or cyan,  zigzag running to an churchyard where has planted full of Prunus persica and Strongylodon Macrobotrys since a grey building was constructed here. 

David Lynch' s humanoid rabbits may as logical as a mêlée or 42 minutes, thus the horror grey of that building may as delicious as February or absurdity. It's not something ridiculous but examinations or bureaucracies.

Governments, so greyly speeking, they ought to be governments themselves. 

One could never been awaken without comprehensively understood what Kant has mentioned that the whole empirical universe is but phenomena rather than the world itself, namely, noumena. Also, Arthur Schopenhauer said that the world is nothing but Māyā's veil. 

I'd never understood the world as the world itself or not the world itself, everything except nothing means nothing to me, since one day when I'm perhaps awken the insane river told me that human reason sometimes fuckingly means nothing and sometimes means it's fucking nothing.

One day when I'm perhaps dead, I give all those textbooks subject to mathemathics up. The very sensation in my mind was catastropic boredom, total life cheated me so deeply that when I finally understood it, I found me, Evelyn Chieh named, had just living in a fatal tragedy. There was no any confessing life towards me, even gulit. So what is exactly a fatal game? What is exactly a fucking tragedy? There was nothing I wanted even more than to live as a normal man like others. Thou fucking God doesn't told me anything that could be taken as an explanation.

Grey building! One day I was talking to someone when I can't remember who I told was. So grey! I screamed in a terrible voice. So grey! So grey! Grey!… All silent screaming. I was wandered with everybody. But Truman is the lucky one who lives in a designed world where is full of designed luck.

I exists in a grey building, everything except nothing is nothing here. A grey nightmare told me that the intrinsic truth the world maintains is an unkind phantom.

Maybe, to impress me a strong belief that it's illogical to negate the existence of the world the subject of the grey nightmare instinctively designed the temporal memory and the whole history to me, insofar as I metaphysically awaken then put them in skepticism.

So dangerous metaphysics is to the sin subject, to be a real philosopher as Plato or Kant is hard, but who can guarantee their existence, and who can prove that the empirical world is itself an empirical world? If bouth sides exists, though there are some probabilities that the relation between the noumenal and the phenomenal world is an one-to-one correspondence, there are also probabilities that it's just a 'normal' morphism, the noumenal world even but a single 'one'. As Descartes's hypothesis that the phenomenal world was designed by a demon.

Let's assume again that the history is exists now. One lightning has broken the grey sky since the dictum 'cogito, ergo sum' coined by René Descartes 385 years ago. Ego, hitherto taken as a fundament of human reason, was demonstrated existence by the pseudo-truth that one can negate everything but the negating subject, for there are some probabilities that the universe containing λόγος was designed by a demon, as we mentioned above. Thus there is a sufficient reason to suspect the λόγος based on a priori Anschauung rather than daily experiences.

Long ago, slience told me that universe is too infinite to make sense, beyond pink Prunus persica and cyan Strongylodon Macrobotrys, scarred soul would have an eventual reunion with starry sky. Being in the empirical world is itself a paradox, so what will happen when he finally get rid of all heavy fetters then turn around to the sun? Nirvāṇa Brahman had taught, so get rid of the grey building with thy profoundly eternal silencio, beyond the zigzag river then finally fly to the noumenal world then facing to Māyā's veil and the noumenon of nothing itself.
